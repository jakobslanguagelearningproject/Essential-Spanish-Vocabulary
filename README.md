# Essential Spanish Vocabulary Podcast

## About
Essential Spanish Vocabulary is an AI-powered language learning podcast that presents Spanish vocabulary in order of frequency. This project aims to help language learners efficiently master the most important words first.

## How It Works
Each episode focuses on a specific frequency range of Spanish words and follows a consistent format:
- English word
- Spanish translation
- Spanish example sentence
- English translation of the sentence
- Spanish example sentence repeated at a slightly slower pace
- Second Spanish example sentence, with translation and repetition

- ## Content Creation Process
The podcast content is partially generated using AI technology for translations and example sentences, then carefully reviewed by human language experts before publication. While we strive for accuracy, language is complex and errors may occasionally occur.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to improve this project:
1. **Report errors**: If you find any inaccuracies in translations or example sentences, please open an issue
2. **Suggest improvements**: Ideas for better examples or content structure are always welcome
3. **Language expansion**: If you're interested in helping expand to other languages, please reach out
