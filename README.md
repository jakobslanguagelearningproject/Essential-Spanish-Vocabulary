# Essential Vocabulary Podcasts - JakobsLanguageLearningProject

## About
I am creating language learning podcasts that present vocabulary in order of frequency. This project aims to help language learners efficiently master the most important words first across different languages.

## How It Works
Each episode focuses on a specific frequency range of words and follows a consistent format:
- English word
- Target language translation
- 1-3 Target language example sentences with their english translations and a repitition

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to improve this project:
1. **Report errors**: If you find any inaccuracies in translations or example sentences, please open an issue
2. **Suggest improvements**: Ideas for better examples or content structure are always welcome
3. **Language expansion**: If you're interested in helping expand to other languages, please reach out

## Work in Progress
This project is actively under development.
